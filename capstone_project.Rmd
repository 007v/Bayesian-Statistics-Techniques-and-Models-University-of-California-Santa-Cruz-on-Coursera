## Introduction

The data set that we will analyze is the opening response time (ms) of an electromechanical valve.
The valve controls the flow of several fluids where the opening and closing is actuated by a solenoid.
The shutoff seal is an elastomer that is attached to the end of the solenoid plunger.
In this project, we will determine how the seal vintage, fluid and applied coil voltage affects the valve's opening response time.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
